3385,University of Chicago (UC),Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations ,"$26,480",1.09,2017-2018,3rd,"Salary includes money earned for teaching, which is a requirement. For each class (stand alone) <span class=""truncated""> taught, PhD student receives 2 teaching points. We need 5 teaching points (2x stand alone teaching and 1x TA&#39;ing, or 5x TA&#39;ing a class) before graduation. For teaching a stand alone course, students gets &#39;paid&#39; $6000. But this is already included in the stipend. If student cannot find TA or teaching position, they will receive a lower stipend than the $25000 promised.
The required fees are the quarterly Student Life Fee. If you do not take classes in the summer, you pay $380 less than the $1520 stated. In exchange for the Student Life Fee, you get free access to general physician, as well as events (social events, yoga classes, mental health activities etc). 
Rent in Hyde Park area is around $1100-1600 for a one-bed room apartment, less for a studio or room in shared apartment. 
The University also pays for the PhD student&#39;s health insurance (United Healthcare) which covers a lot. The Out of Pocket is $500, and co-pay of 10% goes until another $1000. So if you have medical costs above $1500 everything is paid for.

For humanities students, there are limited resources for funds for conference travels etc. Costs outside of rent/gas/phone bills/groceries need some managing, but everything depends on the rent situation. Many graduate students live in shared housing, and can thus afford a conference every once in a while.

Many students in the humanities have some sort of student job, e.g. working at publications office, helping professors with databases, publications,  working at the language center, UChicago Grad etc. These often pay around $15/hour, but it can also be less. 

PhD-students with families can get $2000 extra a year from the University. This is officially for child care, but can be spend any way you want. This does not cover child care premiums (ca. $1100-1800 a month per child in the area, depending on the facility).

I have a small additional <span class=""truncated""> yearly scholarship of $2,500. I bet maybe one-third to one-half of the graduate students in my department have a small additional scholarship like this, usually between $2,500 and $5,000.

You are expected to serve as a teaching assistant for one year and a co-instructor of record for one semester—neither of these roles increase the stipend.

I did not include in my pay calculation the part-time job on campus that I have. Emory allows graduate students to perform 10 hours of outside work per week. I haven&#39;t regularly had a part-time job during graduate school, but if I did, it would give me an extra $5,000 per year. Maybe one-third of the students do part-time work at any given time.

Atlanta in general has a low cost of living, though it has begun to rise in recent years. Finding an affordable, non-shitty apartment within a reasonable distance of campus can be difficult, but overall I feel like I can afford the necessities as well as a few frivolities.

A very important note: starting in the academic year 2019-2020, the Laney Graduate School at Emory will set the minimum base stipend of all of their programs at $31,000. Some of the STEM disciplines were already around this salary, but it feels historic to me for graduate students in humanities disciplines like mine to be paid that high. For some context, according to an online city-to-city cost-of-living calculator, students in Boston would need $44,800 for the same purchasing power as $31,000 in Atlanta; students in Chicago would need $36,100, Berkeley, $45,600, Brooklyn, $53,700. </span>","$26,500",,,"$1,063"

Additionally, as a marine biologist, summer is the busiest (=most expensive) time for collecting data, and I&#39;m skidding into Fall quarter with almost nothing in checking or savings, even while splitting costs with my partner. Santa Cruz is nightmarishly expensive as a grad student-- I paid over $1000 a month in rent and utilities to live in a semi-renovated garage (read: still had an uninsulated garage door) for two years. I have moved in with my boyfriend about 13 miles away from the office. This has blown up my gas usage, but saves me about $400/mo.

Summer funding is NOT guaranteed. Only those who&#39;ve passed their comps are eligible to teach and it depends on if you will be available and able to do it. Usually 3rd years on up are the ones doing it. There&#39;s rumblings eventually the college will make summer funding guaranteed but they are extremely slow so don&#39;t count on it. It&#39;s $6k per summer semester and there&#39;s two summer semesters. I haven&#39;t heard of anyone teaching both summer semesters (usually you&#39;re off doing research.)

Hosing in Santa Cruz is ridiculous. My single room in a shared 6-bed/2-bath house costs just over $1000/month, and I count myself lucky. Most grad students are spending over 50 or 60% of income on rent.

My offer only guarantees 3 years of funding, with years 2 and 3 coming from TA-ships. Though it sounds like students are generally okay finding funding through a mix of psych TA-ships, TA-ships in other departments, grants/fellowships, or various intern positions with campus departments.

TA rates are set by a UC-wide union contract, and there&#39;s an active campaign on the UCSC campus this year to get a cost of living adjustment to address the local cost of housing.</span>",,"$20,607",,$624

The employment <span class=""truncated""> contract feels a little misleading. The contract requires an average of 20 hrs work per week at a rate of ~$25/hr (you only get paid for a maximum of 20 hrs/week).  - You will be working 40hr/week though. Everybody is, and most are also pushing into the 60hrs/week range as well. Fine, it&#39;s research, we love it, it&#39;s not about the hours. And it&#39;s mostly fine during the semester when you have a couple of classes taking up ~10 hours during the week. However, during the summer, when you&#39;re taking no classes you&#39;re still there for 40 hrs and only getting paid for 20. In reality, you&#39;re getting paid ~$12.50 an hour (or worse if you&#39;re there for even more hours).  It feels strange and dishonest when I fill out payroll sheets that only show 1/2 the time I&#39;m working. In any other job, this would be called wage theft, but since its in academia, it&#39;s considered research experience... Rather than hiding behind the guise of hourly rates, I wish the contract would list the position as salary. </span>","$26,426",,,

The tuition and fees are broken down as follows:
tuition: 1000 per semester (including summer) = 3000 total
fees: 172.30 per credit hour at 35 credit hours = 6,030.50
mandatory health insurance = 2450 (if you have health insurance through a parent or spouse or purchase ACA coverage this number may be different)

The program tells us that &#34;Any and all work outside of program requirements and activity needs to be formally requested in
writing to the DCT prior to any student engaging in such work. Only part-time work will be considered (i.e., 20-hours of work/week or less). The DCT will discuss this proposal with the
student&#39;s mentor and the Clinical Training Committee (CTC), and a formal decision regarding this work will be provided to the student in writing. If a student’s work outside of the program is approved, they will be required to continually update the DCT about their work situation, at minimum, at the end of each semester or
until the work situation is concluded. Failure to maintain satisfactory progress in the program, or failure to file semester reports, may result in the CTC re-evaluating the decision to allow students to work outside of the program&#34;</span>",,"$9,000",,"$11,490"
